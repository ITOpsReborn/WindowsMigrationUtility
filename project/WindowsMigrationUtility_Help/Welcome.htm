<H1>Welcome to Windows Migration Utility (WMU) Help</H1>

<p>Pomeroy’s Windows Migration Utility (WMU) is built for migrating user and system data to a user defined location. Configuration of what is captured and restored uses USMT’s methodology of specifying configuration rules in XML files. Configuration information for gathering an enterprise’s requirements for user migration and how to build these XML files can be found <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825142.aspx">here</a>. WMU utilizes the latest USMT version 5.0, so there is no reason for worrying about mapped network drives and printers USMT 5.0 does it. <p/>
<p>WMU is built with C# and uses .Net Framework 2.0. WMU out of the box should work with 95% of all Windows XP Pro machines. WMU also allows help desk personnel to capture and restore remote machines utilizing Microsoft’s PSExec command line utility. WMU has built in configuration options for running commands before a capture is ran and running commands after a restore has finished. It brings the Configuration Manager’s Task Sequence idea to a graphical user interface. WMU comes as installation program but also it includes an ZIP file for running the program in standalone mode.</p> 
<p>WMU Supports these scenarios:</br></br>
Windows XP Pro to Windows 7 /or/ Windows 8</br>
Windows 7 to Windows 7 /or/ Windows 8</br>
Windows 8 to Windows 8</br></p>
<p>If the data is captured by WMU it has to be restored by WMU as the data is stored in a compressed and encrypted MIG file. WMU also supports restoring user data captured from other programs utilizing custom decryption keys or hard linking. 
</p>
<p>
With this application being written in .Net Framework 2.0 it supports Windows &reg XP Pro and above. </br></br>

This program comes with an installation, but with the installation it also a zip file.  This application can be ran in a standalone mode.
